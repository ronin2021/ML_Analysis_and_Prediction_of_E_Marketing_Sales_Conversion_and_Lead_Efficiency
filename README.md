# ML Analysis and Prediction of E Marketing Sales Conversion and Lead Efficiency

### Outline
This is a machine learning base analysis and prediction on e-marketing sales conversions and lead efficiency. There two .ipynb files with 3 .csv with data. Please read the report in the ML_Analysis_and_Prediction_of_the_E_Marketing_Sales_Conversion_and_Lead_Efficiency.pdf file.

### Part 1. Analysis and ML model on sales conversions
Analysis Data were uploaded from .csv file followed by ETL. Data anlysis was performed using pandas. Visualizations were via haloview.

Predictive modeling Linear Regression analysis for classification was carried on the same dataframe. Accuracy score was 0.60 which was poor very likely due to the small (280) sample size. However, as a proof of concept this predictive model by increasing the smaple size, carefully parsing through appropriate model and parameters the model could be improved.

### Part 2. Analysis of Sales Conversions Efficiency
Analysis Data were uploaded from .csv file followed by ETL. Data anlysis was performed using pandas. Visualizations were via haloview.

#### Inputs 
Data were read from conversion_rates.csv, lead_sale_stats.csv, and names_id_age.csv for the analysis.

#### Outputs 
Outputs are given out as mentioned above on the terminal as calculated values, visual plots/graphs/figures, and explanations about the results.

#### Remarks 
This is a small data set as such predictive nature is somewhat weak.
